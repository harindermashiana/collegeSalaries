    "text": "We chose to study college major choice and post-graduation salaries because it is an important decision that shapes career trajectories for millions of students each year. The three datasets on undergraduate salaries provide a wealth of insights into how expected compensation varies across areas of study, college types, and geographic regions.\nFor High Schoolers debating what to study or where to attend college, few factors matter more than potential return on investment. Students and families have a right to understand how choices of major and college may impact future earnings and career options after graduation. However, quality data on long-term outcomes remains frustratingly opaque at many educational institutions.\nBy integrating data on starting and mid-career salaries by major, college type, and state, my analysis aims to uncover key insights like:\n\nWhich majors provide the highest average salaries post-graduation? How much do the top majors outearn the lowest paying majors?\nDoes the earnings boost from certain elite colleges justify their high tuition prices? Or are public colleges in students’ home states the better bargain?\nHow does expected pay from the same major differ across geographic regions? How much of an advantage exists from studying or working in a major city?\nFor a given target salary level, what combinations of major and college type are most promising? What pathways are riskier from an ROI standpoint?\n\nThis data allows applicants to look beyond simplistic rankings and assess how academic decisions may impact their career and earning potential. By arming students and families with detailed salary outcomes, colleges can also be held more accountable for the return they provide on expensive four-year investments. Ultimately the goal is to bring greater transparency that promotes affordable degrees and careers aligned to student interests and strengths."

    "text": "2.1 Description\n\ndegrees-that-pay-back.csv\n\nThis file contains median salary data (starting, mid-career, percentiles) for various undergraduate majors such as Engineering, Business, Liberal Arts, Healthcare, etc. Useful for seeing salary trajectories and ranges for different majors.\n\nsalaries-by-college-type.csv\n\nThis file shows median salaries (starting and mid-career) grouped by college type - Engineering colleges, Liberal Arts colleges, Ivy League schools, etc. Gives salary outcomes based on college types rather than majors specifically.\n\nsalaries-by-region.csv\n\nThis file aggregates salaries by region - West, Midwest, Northeast, South. Shows range of salaries for graduates from schools in different geographic areas. Helps compare regional salary differences.\n\n2.1.1 Format:\n\nData is structured as CSV files with header rows naming each column, and subsequent rows containing the data values\nThere is a mix of text and numeric data in columns\nVarying number of columns across the files (13-16 columns)\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Dimensions:\n\ndegrees-that-pay-back.csv: 32 rows x 16 columns\nsalaries-by-college-type.csv: 130 rows x 12 columns\nsalaries-by-region.csv: 344 rows x 12 columns\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Issues:\n\nSome inconsistent formatting (e.g. school names sometimes abbreviated, use of “—” instead of “N/A”)\nSalary columns contain string values with “$” and “,” formatting rather than standardized numeric values\nIt is not clear what year(s) the salary data represents"

California, although a state and not a region, has a very large number of colleges and hence has been assigned its own category.\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Mid Career Salaries Across the Map\nAs we dive deeper, we discover that the financial contours of a career post-college are not uniform. Mid-career salaries vary significantly across regions and college types, unveiling economic landscapes shaped by education.\n\n3.2.2.1 Visual: Mid-career salary distribution by Region\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(scales)\nsalaries_reg %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = `Mid.Career.Median.Salary`)) +\n  facet_wrap(~`Region`, ncol = 2) + \n  geom_histogram(bins = 15, fill = \"skyblue\", color = \"black\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Mid-Career Salaries by Region\",\n    x = \"Mid-Career Median Salary\"\n  ) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_comma()) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Creating overlaid density histograms\nggplot(salaries_reg, aes(x = Mid.Career.Median.Salary, fill = Region)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.4) +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Mid-Career Salaries by Region\",\n       x = \"Mid-Career Median Salary\",\n       y = \"Density\") + \n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") + scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format())\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the mid career salaries of graduates from various schools, it is clearly visible that salaries of grads from schools located in the Midwest, West, and South never cross the 110k mark. But there are grads from schools in the Northeast and in California who have received salaries upwards of 110k, a few years into their field.\nThe peaks of the density curves of the various regions also show the most common salary range for schools in each region.\n\n\n3.2.2.2 Visual: Mid-career salary distribution by School type\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(scales)\n\nsalaries_col %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = `Mid.Career.Median.Salary`)) +\n  facet_wrap(~`School.Type`, scales = \"free_y\", ncol = 2) + \n  geom_histogram(bins = 15, fill = \"skyblue\", color = \"black\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Mid-Career Salaries by School Type\",\n    x = \"Mid-Career Median Salary\"\n  ) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_comma()) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Creating overlaid density histograms\nggplot(salaries_col, aes(x = Mid.Career.Median.Salary, fill = School.Type)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.4) +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Mid-Career Salaries by School Type\",\n       x = \"Mid-Career Median Salary\",\n       y = \"Density\") + \n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Set3\") + scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format())\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduates from Ivy league schools have the highest salaries a few years into their careers (mid career), as can be seen clearly from the plot above. The lower limit of their mid career salary range itself is 110k which is the upper limit for grads from State and Liberal Arts schools.\nParty school grads seem to have the lowest mid career salaries among the available school types, with an upper limit of 100k.\nA few engineering schools had grads with mid career salaries upwards of 110k, but still not as high as the ones from Ivy leagues.\nThe overlaid density curves make it easier to visualize and conclude the above points.\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Top 10 Schools by Mid Career Salary\nWe will now look at the top 10 schools based on the mid career median salary.

And since Ivy leagues are among the colleges with highest median salaries, we can relate it to the result of Northeastern region having a higher salary range."

This result is consistent from the conclusion from the above distribution graphs, where we saw engineering majors having higher salary ranges. The other two majors are related to the medical field.\nLooking at the bottom 10 majors, there is very little variation among starting salaries of grads from these majors. For comparison, we note that the bottom 3 are Education, Religion, and Spanish.\n\n\n3.3.1.2 Visual: Top and bottom 10 majors by mid-career salaries\n\n\nCode\n# | warnings = FALSE\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggpubr)\n\nmajors = degrees\n\nplot1 <- majors %>%\n  arrange(desc(`Mid.Career.Median.Salary`)) %>% \n  top_n(10, wt = `Mid.Career.Median.Salary`) %>%\n  mutate(Rank = row_number()) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(fill = Undergraduate.Major, y = reorder(Undergraduate.Major, Mid.Career.Median.Salary), x = `Mid.Career.Median.Salary`)) +\n  geom_col() + xlim(0, 110000) +\n  labs(title = \"Top 10 Majors by Mid Career Median Salary\", x = \"Mid Career Median Salary\", y = \"Undergraduate Major\") +\n  theme_minimal() + guides(fill = FALSE)\n\nplot2 <- majors %>% \n  arrange(`Mid.Career.Median.Salary`) %>%\n  top_n(-10, wt = `Mid.Career.Median.Salary`)  %>%\n  mutate(Rank = row_number()) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(fill = Undergraduate.Major, x = `Mid.Career.Median.Salary`, y = reorder(Undergraduate.Major, Mid.Career.Median.Salary))) +\n  geom_col() + xlim(0, 110000) +\n  labs(title = \"Bottom 10 Majors by Mid Career Median Salary\", x = \"Mid Career Median Salary\", y = \"Undergraduate Major\") +\n  theme_minimal() + guides(fill = FALSE)\n\n\nggarrange(plot1, plot2, nrow = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is, however, some major shuffling in the ranking as we move from comparing Starting Salaries to Mid Career Salaries. Now, 7 out of the initial 8 engineering majors have retained their place in the top 10 but Civil Engineering has dropped in ranking. Both the medical majors have also dropped and Math, Physics and Economics, all related to the ‘Sciences’ have entered the top 10.\nFor the bottom 10 majors, the last 3 majors (Education, Religion, Spanish) have retained their place (with some shuffling among themselves.) Criminal Justice, Music, and Drama are still in the bottom 10 and there are 4 new entries.\nEach of the bottom 10 majors’ grads still had a salary less than 60k after working for a few years, while the 10 10 majors’ grads had a salary higher than 60k even at the start of their career.\n\n\n3.3.1.3 Visual: Top and bottom 10 majors by percent change from starting to mid career salary\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggpubr)\n\nmajors = degrees\n\nplot3 <- majors %>%\n  arrange(desc(`Percent.change.from.Starting.to.Mid.Career.Salary`)) %>% \n  top_n(10, wt = `Percent.change.from.Starting.to.Mid.Career.Salary`) %>%\n  mutate(Rank = row_number()) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(fill = Undergraduate.Major, y = reorder(Undergraduate.Major, Percent.change.from.Starting.to.Mid.Career.Salary), x = `Percent.change.from.Starting.to.Mid.Career.Salary`)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  labs(title = \"Top 10 Majors by Percent.change.from.Starting.to.Mid.Career.Salary\", x = \"Percent.change.from.Starting.to.Mid.Career.Salary\", y = \"Undergraduate Major\") +\n  theme_minimal() + guides(fill = FALSE)\n\n\nplot4 <- majors %>%\n  arrange(desc(`Percent.change.from.Starting.to.Mid.Career.Salary`)) %>% \n  top_n(10, wt = `Percent.change.from.Starting.to.Mid.Career.Salary`) %>%\n  mutate(Rank = row_number()) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(fill = Undergraduate.Major, y = reorder(Undergraduate.Major, Percent.change.from.Starting.to.Mid.Career.Salary), x = `Mid.Career.Median.Salary`)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  labs(title = \"Mid Career Median Salary of Top 10 Majors by Percent.change\", x = \"Mid Career Median Salary\", y = \"Undergraduate Major\") +\n  theme_minimal() + guides(fill = FALSE)\n\nggarrange(plot3, plot4, nrow = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the two adjacent plots above, it is evident that the major that saw the maximum percent increase in the median salary was not the one with the highest mid career median salary. Knowing this is important because, there are many instance where we see headlines like “Philosophy majors saw a 104 percent increment in five years after graduating from college” (an example.) A large portion of the audience is not familiar with how numbers can be manipulated and presented to spread a certain opinion. And students deciding majors for college are among them too (majority.) This can be misleading and hence it becomes important to understand that percents and actual numbers can reveal different insights and one should be careful when reading headlines which present facts using percents."

Each line represents a school, and the colors tell a story of school types.\n\n3.4.1.1 Visual: Parallel coordinate plot showcasing salaries by college type\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(GGally)\n\nsalaries_col$School.Type <- as.factor(salaries_col$School.Type)\nsalaries_col$School.Name <- as.factor(salaries_col$School.Name)\nggparcoord(\n  salaries_col,\n  columns = c(3, 4),\n  groupColumn = \"School.Type\",\n  scale = \"globalminmax\",\n  alphaLines = 0.4,\n  splineFactor = FALSE,\n  boxplot = TRUE,\n  # order = c(3, 5, 6, 4, 7, 8)\n) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") +  facet_wrap(~ School.Type, ncol = 3) +\n  labs(title = \"PCP: Start & Mid Career Median Salaries by College Type\", x = \"Variable\", y = \"Salary\")\n\n\n\n\n\nKey observations from the plot:\n\nStarting salaries: Engineering graduates have the highest starting median salaries across all regions, followed by Ivy League graduates. Liberal Arts and Party schools have lower starting salaries.\nSalary increase: Graduates from all college types experience an increase in median salary from starting to mid-career. Ivy League graduates have the highest percentage increase (99%), followed by Party schools (85%) and Engineering schools (76%). Liberal Arts graduates have a slightly lower increase (74%).\nEngineering majors have the highest median starting salary at $80,000, followed by Ivy League graduates at $75,000, and liberal arts graduates at $60,000.\nEngineering majors also have the highest median mid-career salary at $150,000, followed by Ivy League graduates at $130,000, and liberal arts graduates at $100,000.\nThe median mid-career salary for all six school types is higher than the median starting salary. This suggests that, on average, workers can expect their earnings to increase over time.\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(GGally)\n\nsalaries_col$School.Type <- as.factor(salaries_col$School.Type)\nsalaries_col$School.Name <- as.factor(salaries_col$School.Name)\nggparcoord(\n  salaries_col,\n  columns = 4:8,\n  groupColumn = \"School.Type\",\n  scale = \"globalminmax\",\n  alphaLines = 0.4,\n  splineFactor = FALSE,\n  order = c(5, 6, 4, 7, 8)\n) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") + facet_wrap(~ School.Type) +  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format()) +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Mid Career Median Salaries by College Type\", x = \"Variable\", y = \"Salary\")\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles of the median mid career salaries for each school in each college type category above. The Parallel Coordinate plots faceted by college type show the range of these values and if there are outliers for each variable.\nFor instance, the largest difference between 90th percentile and 10th percentile mid career median salary is for Ivy Leagues. A few party and state schools have a higher 90th percentile value compared to others in their category. These results are similar to analyzing a box plot, only here we are given the values of the percentiles and not the continuous data to determine them.\n\n\n\n3.4.2 Salaries by Region (Parallel Coordinate Plot)\nChanging the lens, the parallel coordinate plot re-imagines our narrative. The colors now represent different regions, uncovering geographic nuances in career trajectories.\n\n3.4.2.1 Visual: Parallel coordinate plot showcasing salaries by region\n\n\nCode\nsalaries_reg$Region <- as.factor(salaries_reg$Region)\nsalaries_reg$School.Name <- as.factor(salaries_reg$School.Name)\n\nggparcoord(\n  salaries_reg,\n  columns = c(3, 4),\n  groupColumn = \"Region\",\n  scale = \"globalminmax\",\n  alphaLines = 0.2,\n  splineFactor = FALSE,\n  showPoints = TRUE,\n   boxplot = TRUE,\n  # order = c(3, 5, 6, 4, 7, 8)\n) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") +  facet_wrap(~ Region, ncol = 3)+\n  labs(title = \"PCP: Start & Mid Career Median Salaries by Region\", x = \"Variable\", y = \"Salary\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph compares the starting and median salaries for different career stages across five regions in the United States: California, Midwestern, Northeastern, Southern, and Western.\n\nCalifornia boasts the highest median salaries for both starting and mid-career stages, with $75,000 for starting and $130,000 for mid-career.\nThe Northeastern region follows closely, with medians of $70,000 and $120,000 for starting and mid-career, respectively.\nSalaries for all regions tend to be higher in the mid-career stage compared to the starting stage, indicating potential for career growth within each region.\nThe Southern and Western regions have the lowest median salaries for both starting and mid-career stages, with medians around $60,000 and $100,000, respectively.\nThe Midwestern region occupies the middle ground, with median salaries around $65,000 for starting and $110,000 for mid-career.\n\n\n\nCode\nggparcoord(\n  salaries_reg,\n  columns = 4:8,\n  groupColumn = \"Region\",\n  scale = \"globalminmax\",\n  alphaLines = 0.2,\n  splineFactor = FALSE,\n  showPoints = FALSE,\n   boxplot = FALSE,\n  order = c(5, 6, 4, 7, 8)\n) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") +  facet_wrap(~ Region, ncol = 3) +  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format()) + labs(title = \"Distribution of Mid Career Median Salaries by Region\", x = \"Variable\", y = \"Salary\")\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to the PCP faceted by college type, this one is faceted by region. Each region seems to have some outliers in the 75th and 90th percentile variable columns. Mid career salaries of Northeastern colleges have the highest range and that of Western colleges has the lowest."

To delve deeper into the data set and see if there are significant relationships between region and college type regarding salaries, we can try merging the two tables. But, when we do that, we observe that the School.Name columns in both the tables are not exactly the same.\nWhen we try merging them, we notice that there are some schools in both tables that are unique to them and not present in the other which created rows with null values. This number of rows with null values is not a small number which we can deal with by dropping the rows, and hence we analyze the two tables separately and try to find a relation without merging them."

    "text": "As we step back, the picture becomes clear. The journey through college, majors, and careers is complex, nuanced, and individualized. There’s no one-size-fits-all, and every decision we make adds a unique thread to our personal tapestry.\n\n\nA compelling discovery surfaces when examining the regional influence on salaries after graduation. Graduates from schools in the Northeast and California consistently outpace their counterparts from the Midwest, both at the commencement of their careers and a decade later. This regional dichotomy poses questions about the economic and professional environments that different regions offer to recent graduates.\n\n\n\nThe diversity in school types, including Liberal Arts colleges, State Schools, and Ivy League institutions, introduces a captivating dynamic to the narrative. The prevailing group in terms of mid career salaries is the Ivy league in the type of colleges, and engineering in the type of major while Social Science and Arts remain at the bottom. Party schools, traditionally associated with a more laid-back atmosphere, surprisingly show a significant boost in earnings over the years, challenging preconceived notions about the impact of the college environment on career trajectories.\n\n\n\nMajors, often a source of familial concern, demonstrate a fascinating story of their own. Fields such as Philosophy and Liberal Arts, sometimes perceived as less lucrative, prove to yield substantial financial returns a decade post-commencement. This challenges the conventional wisdom surrounding the financial viability of certain academic pursuits. Conversely, the data also points to majors like Nursing and Information Technology, where salary growth doesn’t match the pace seen in other disciplines.\n\n\n\nTo distill these complex relationships, parallel coordinates offer a visual narrative. They provide an intuitive understanding of how variables interact, offering a comprehensive view of the intricate relationships between regions, school types, and majors.\n\n\n\nFor prospective students, these findings underscore the importance of thoughtful decision-making. It’s not merely about where you start but also the trajectory you embark upon. This analysis empowers educators to guide students effectively and informs policymakers about the regional disparities that might necessitate targeted interventions."
