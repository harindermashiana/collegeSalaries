    "text": "We chose to study college major choice and post-graduation salaries because it is an important decision that shapes career trajectories for millions of students each year. The three datasets on undergraduate salaries provide a wealth of insights into how expected compensation varies across areas of study, college types, and geographic regions.\nFor High Schoolers debating what to study or where to attend college, few factors matter more than potential return on investment. Students and families have a right to understand how choices of major and college may impact future earnings and career options after graduation. However, quality data on long-term outcomes remains frustratingly opaque at many educational institutions.\nBy integrating data on starting and mid-career salaries by major, college type, and state, my analysis aims to uncover key insights like:\n\nWhich majors provide the highest average salaries post-graduation? How much do the top majors outearn the lowest paying majors?\nDoes the earnings boost from certain elite colleges justify their high tuition prices? Or are public colleges in students’ home states the better bargain?\nHow does expected pay from the same major differ across geographic regions? How much of an advantage exists from studying or working in a major city?\nFor a given target salary level, what combinations of major and college type are most promising? What pathways are riskier from an ROI standpoint?\n\nThis data allows applicants to look beyond simplistic rankings and assess how academic decisions may impact their career and earning potential. By arming students and families with detailed salary outcomes, colleges can also be held more accountable for the return they provide on expensive four-year investments. Ultimately the goal is to bring greater transparency that promotes affordable degrees and careers aligned to student interests and strengths."

    "text": "2.1 Description\n\ndegrees-that-pay-back.csv\n\nThis file contains median salary data (starting, mid-career, percentiles) for various undergraduate majors such as Engineering, Business, Liberal Arts, Healthcare, etc. Useful for seeing salary trajectories and ranges for different majors.\n\nsalaries-by-college-type.csv\n\nThis file shows median salaries (starting and mid-career) grouped by college type - Engineering colleges, Liberal Arts colleges, Ivy League schools, etc. Gives salary outcomes based on college types rather than majors specifically.\n\nsalaries-by-region.csv\n\nThis file aggregates salaries by region - West, Midwest, Northeast, South. Shows range of salaries for graduates from schools in different geographic areas. Helps compare regional salary differences.\n\n2.1.1 Format:\n\nData is structured as CSV files with header rows naming each column, and subsequent rows containing the data values\nThere is a mix of text and numeric data in columns\nVarying number of columns across the files (13-16 columns)\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Dimensions:\n\ndegrees-that-pay-back.csv: 32 rows x 16 columns\nsalaries-by-college-type.csv: 130 rows x 12 columns\nsalaries-by-region.csv: 344 rows x 12 columns\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Issues:\n\nSome inconsistent formatting (e.g. school names sometimes abbreviated, use of “—” instead of “N/A”)\nSalary columns contain string values with “$” and “,” formatting rather than standardized numeric values\nIt is not clear what year(s) the salary data represents"
